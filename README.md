## Ke's Update

The old manuf looks broken, please set it from source with recent data.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ktian-zingbox/manuf.git

cd manuf (where setup.py located)

```
Install from the source

```
python setup.py install --user


Installed /Users/ktian/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/manuf-2.0.1-py3.7.egg
Processing dependencies for manuf==2.0.1
Finished processing dependencies for manuf==2.0.1
```

And double check the path and its content 

```
